### Portfolio Risk Simulator
The portfolio risk simulator is a powerful tool that allows you to assess your portfolio's risk using
Monte Carlo Simulation. The simulation unravels crucial metrics: Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value 
at Risk (CVaR). VaR adn CVaR are two of the most popular risk metrics used by financial institutions to 
measure the risk of their portfolios. Simulation can be tailored to your needs by adjusting the number 
of simulations, historical data of your selected stocks, the confidence levels (alpha). The simulation 
will also generate a line chart for your portfolio's daily returns. All data can be downloaded as a CSV file for
further analysis.
